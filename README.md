# Grovio - Automated Intelligent Plant Monitoring System

The product makes use of food waste to produce organic fertiliser to grow vegetables organically. The automated system uses an Intelligent Plant Monitoring System `(IPMS)` to nurture vegetables. A mobile application stores the plant database that is connected to the IPMS which delivers the required amount of fertiliser according to each plant whenever required. This versatile system doesnâ€™t require human intervention besides in the stages of dumping waste, sowing seeds & harvesting vegetables. System also uses a soil-substitute to nurture any plant other than tubers.
The details of the project were published in `Deccan Chronicle`, `15 May 2019` Edition.
