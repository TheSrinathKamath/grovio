# Grovio - Automated Intelligent Plant Monitoring System

![Project demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gYDgSqO4EMlfJ4sFpSUAHvjC2CFiNY6f/view)

The product makes use of food waste to produce organic fertiliser to grow vegetables organically. The automated system uses an Intelligent Plant Monitoring System `(IPMS)` to nurture vegetables.
A mobile application stores the plant database that is connected to the IPMS which delivers the required amount of fertiliser according to each plant whenever required. This versatile system doesnâ€™t require human intervention besides in the stages of dumping waste, sowing seeds & harvesting vegetables. System also uses a soil-substitute to nurture any plant other than tubers.
