<p>The product makes use of food waste to produce organic fertiliser to grow vegetables organically. The automated system uses an Intelligent Plant Monitoring System <code>(IPMS)</code> to nurture vegetables.
A mobile application stores the plant database that is connected to the IPMS which delivers the required amount of fertiliser according to each plant whenever required. This versatile system doesn’t require human intervention besides in the stages of dumping waste, sowing seeds &amp; harvesting vegetables. System also uses a soil-substitute to nurture any plant other than tubers.</p>
